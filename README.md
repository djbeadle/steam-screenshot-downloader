# Steam Screenshot Downloader / Backup Tool

Downloads all of the public (not private or unlisted) screenshots associated with a Steam profile

This repository is a fork of [Salies' Steam Screenshot Backup Tool](https://github.com/Salies/steam-screenshot-backup-tool).

## Notes:
- Does a complete download of the user's screenshot each run. 

## Changes made:
- üêõ Fixed bug where last page's worth of screenshots were not downloaded
- ‚ú® Changed screenshot name to the unique screenshot ID instead of an arbitrary number
- ‚ú® Folders of screenshots separated by user
- ‚ú® Incremental downloading of metadata and images
- üé® Replaced some recursive logic

## Future work (I am happy to accept PRs for these!):
- Command line flags for downloading user accounts

## Usage
Have **Node v10** or later installed. Using the latest [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is recommended.
